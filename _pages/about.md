My name is Perrine MAUREL and I am a first year PhD Student. I work on the characterisation of literary style in AI-generated texts, under the direction of [Glenn ROE](https://obtic.sorbonne-universite.fr/equipe-permanente/glenn-roe/), [Jérôme DAVID](https://www.unige.ch/lettres/framo/enseignants/corps-professoral/jerome-david) and [Motasem Alrahabi](https://obtic.sorbonne-universite.fr/equipe-permanente/motasem-alrahabi/).

Laboratory
------
I am working for the [Observatoire des Textes, des Idées et des Corpus](https://obtic.sorbonne-universite.fr/) [Observatory of Texts, Ideas and Corpora, ObTIC]. Our workspace is within the [Sorbonne Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://scai.sorbonne-universite.fr/) [SCAI], 4 place Jussieu, Paris, France.

During my PhD, I participate to their events, talks and various projects. We also act as consultants when other laboratory's projects need a touch of digital humanities.

Specialities
------
I have a diploma in Digital Humanities and work mainly on online creative communities, named entity recognition and AI-generated text content.
