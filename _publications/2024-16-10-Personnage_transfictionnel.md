excerpt: 'The transfictional character is ambiguous: how can we study a character in relation to its variants in other texts? This article examines the theoretical difficulties and proposes the use of named entities to study characters in a transfictional corpus. The methodology adopted and the experimentation with the use of named entities in a transfictional corpus will thus show that the character proves to be a relevant transfictional marker.'
