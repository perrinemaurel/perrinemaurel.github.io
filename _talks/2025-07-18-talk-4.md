(With Arthur AMALVY [Université d’Avignon], Vincent LABATUT [Université d’Avignon], Motasem ALRAHABI [Sorbonne Université]) This study presents the creation of a corpus of 19ᵉ century novels annotated in named entities in their entirety, and the development of a named entity recognition model adapted to such long literary texts, and freely available online. We evaluate its performance, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness.
