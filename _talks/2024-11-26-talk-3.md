Large language models are at the heart of a global and plural reflection on how best to mobilize their capabilities, while taking into account their limitations. In particular, their ability to generate coherent, intelligible and generally credible texts currently constitutes the state of the art (OpenAI, 2023) and is of great interest in generative data augmentation (Whitehouse et al., 2023). As part of a project by Sorbonne University's laboratory ObTIC to create a model for annotating named entities in French novels, we sought to exploit the Llama 3 language model. By first giving it the role of annotation evaluator, we sought to identify the strengths and weaknesses of such an approach in the precise task of named entity recognition, and how best to mobilize this tool.
