The superior adaptability of large language models is double-edged: when they perform specific rather than general tasks, the results produced by these models tend to lose quality (Wang et al., 2024). The solutions offered by technical players (fine-tuning) are sometimes inaccessible to researchers in the humanities and social sciences. The aim of this presentation is therefore to present solutions requiring low technical skills to mobilize large language models in a humanities and social sciences research project, taking the example of the named entity recognition task.
